## 📈 Cost Model Validation

### Phase 2B Actual Costs
```
50 pages with AI headlines = $0.0392
   ├─ Template rendering = $0.00 (local CPU)
   ├─ City data fetching = $0.00 (free APIs)
   ├─ AI headline generation = $0.0392
   └─ Infrastructure = $0.00 (Docker local)
```

### Phase 3 Projections (50,000 Pages)
